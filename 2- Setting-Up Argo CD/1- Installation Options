# Argo CD Installation Options

## Overview

Argo CD can be installed on any running Kubernetes cluster, whether it is a local development setup or a full-scale production environment. Supported cluster types include:

* **Single-node clusters** such as Minikube, Docker Desktop, or Kind
* **Multi-node production clusters**

You can choose the setup that best fits your environment and use case.

## Installation Types

### 1. Non-Highly Available (Non-HA) Setup

* **Purpose:** Suitable for evaluation, development, or test environments.
* **Description:** Argo CD installs **one pod for each component**.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Simple and easy to deploy.
  * Not fault-tolerant (single instance of each component).

---

### 2. Highly Available (HA) Setup

* **Purpose:** Recommended for **production environments**.
* **Requirements:** At least **three worker nodes** in your Kubernetes cluster.
* **Description:**

  * Argo CD deploys multiple replicas of its components across different nodes.
  * Ensures high availability and resilience against node failures.

---

### 3. Lightweight Installation

* **Purpose:** Suitable for **administrative use only**.
* **Description:**

  * Installs Argo CD **without the UI and API server**.
  * By default, it is installed as a **non-HA setup**.
* **Use Case:** Ideal when Argo CD will only be accessed by administrators via CLI.

## Privilege Options

Argo CD can be installed with different privilege levels depending on your deployment scope:

### 1. Cluster-Admin Privileges

* **Purpose:** Use when Argo CD will deploy applications into the **same cluster** where it runs.
* **Access:** Full cluster-wide control.

### 2. Namespace-Level Privileges

* **Purpose:** Use when Argo CD is managing **external clusters** or when limited access is required.
* **Access:** Restricted to a specific namespace.

## Installation Methods

Argo CD supports multiple methods for installation, depending on your preferred deployment tool:

1. **YAML Manifests** – Apply the official installation manifests directly using `kubectl`.
2. **Helm Chart** – Use Helm for templated and configurable installation.
3. **Kustomize** – Customize the manifests for flexible configuration and version control.
