## Argo CD CLI Overview

### Introduction

In this lecture, we will discuss the **Argo CD Command Line Interface (CLI)**. The CLI is one of the primary methods to interact with Argo CD, alongside the **Web UI** and the **REST/gRPC API**.

For automation workflows, particularly within CI/CD pipelines, the **Argo CD CLI** is the recommended tool.

### Capabilities of the CLI

Using the Argo CD CLI, you can perform almost any administrative or operational task available in Argo CD, including:

* Managing **applications**, **repositories**, and **clusters**
* Performing **administrative tasks** such as exporting or importing data
* Conducting **backup and restore** operations
* Managing **projects**
* Executing many other commands for configuration and maintenance

---

### Installation

The Argo CD CLI can be installed on any major operating system, including:

* **Linux**
* **macOS**
* **Windows**

Installation packages and binaries are available in the [official Argo CD GitHub releases page](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases).

### Logging In

Once the CLI is installed, the first step is to **log in** to your Argo CD server.
To do this, the server must be **reachable**. You can make the Argo CD server accessible using one of the following methods:

* **Port forwarding**
* **Ingress controller**
* **LoadBalancer service**

After establishing connectivity, you can log in using the following command:

```bash
argocd login <ARGOCD_SERVER> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>
```

Once logged in, you can start managing your Argo CD resources through the CLI.

### Next Steps

In the next section, we will demonstrate how to use the Argo CD CLI in action — including logging in, listing applications, and performing common management operations.
