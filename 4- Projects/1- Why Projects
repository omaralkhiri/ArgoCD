# **Understanding Why We Need RBCD Projects**

This document explains the purpose of **projects in RBCD** (Repository-Based Continuous Delivery) and how they help organize, secure, and manage application deployments across teams and environments.

---

## **1. What Are Projects in RBCD?**

Projects in RBCD provide a **logical grouping mechanism** for applications.
They allow you to organize multiple applications under a single unit called a “project,” which helps in controlling access, defining deployment rules, and specifying resource usage boundaries.

For example, if you have application **App1**, **App2**, **App3**, and **App4**, you can group them into one project. This helps you manage the applications as a set rather than individually.

## **2. Why Are Projects Needed?**

Projects are mandatory in RBCD because they add essential control and security layers in environments where multiple teams work with the same RBCD installation. They help in:

### **A. Logical Grouping**

* Applications can be grouped meaningfully.
* Easier management and clearer structure.
* Improves multi-team workflows.

### **B. Access Restrictions**

* You can define **which teams** can view, modify, or deploy applications within a project.
* Helps prevent unauthorized access to specific applications.

### **C. Git Repository Restrictions**

* A project can restrict **which Git repositories** its applications are allowed to reference.
* This prevents deployment from untrusted or unintended sources.

### **D. Deployment Destination Restrictions**

You can restrict:

* **Destination clusters**
* **Namespaces**

This ensures that applications in a project can only deploy to **approved environments**, improving both security and compliance.

---

## **3. Resource Usage and Creation Rules**

Projects also allow you to specify **resource usage boundaries**, such as:

* What Kubernetes resources can be created (e.g., Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps).
* Limits around resource consumption in destination clusters.

This feature prevents accidental or unauthorized creation of resources outside the project’s scope.

---

## **4. Project Rules and Policies**

A key feature of RBCD projects is **Project Rules**, which allow you to define sets of permissions—called **policies**—that can be granted to different users or systems. These rules control how external entities interact with project applications.

### **Two Main Use Cases:**

#### **A. Granting CI Systems Limited Access**

You can create a rule that allows a CI/CD system to:

* Sync applications
* Perform specific automated actions
  This is typically done by associating the rule with a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.

This setup ensures automation tools have the access they need—but no more.

#### **B. Granting OIDC Groups Access**

You can assign permissions to identity provider groups, such as:

* GitHub Groups
* GitLab Groups
* Other OIDC-supported identity sources

Example roles you can grant:

* **Read-only** access to applications
* Permission to **sync** applications
* Access to manage specific resources depending on the policy

This makes it easy to provide team-based access control.

---

## **5. Default Project**

When RBCD is installed, it creates a **default project** automatically.
While this can be used for experimentation, **it is recommended to create your own custom projects** because:

* They offer meaningful naming conventions.
* They enable clearer organization.
* They allow more precise access and resource control.

---

## **Conclusion**

RBCD projects are a core component of managing applications efficiently and securely. They provide:

* Logical grouping
* Access and repository restrictions
* Deployment environment control
* Resource usage boundaries
* Fine-grained permission rules

Using well-structured projects is essential when working in multi-team environments, ensuring proper access control, organization, and consistency across deployments.
