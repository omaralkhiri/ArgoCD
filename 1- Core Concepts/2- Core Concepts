# **Argo CD Core Concepts**

This document explains some of the key concepts in **Argo CD**, focusing on **Applications**, **Projects**, and the ideas of **Desired State**, **Actual State**, and **Sync**.

---

## **1. Application**

An **Application** in Argo CD is the fundamental unit that defines what to deploy and where to deploy it.
Each application consists of two main parts:

1. **Source** – The location of your manifests.
   Argo CD supports multiple source types, including:

   * **Helm charts**
   * **Kustomize**
   * **Directory with YAML files**
   * **Jsonnet**

2. **Destination** – The target **cluster** and **namespace** where the application will be deployed.

In short, an application defines:

* **What** to deploy (source)
* **Where** to deploy it (destination)

---

## **2. Project**

A **Project** in Argo CD acts as a **logical grouping** of multiple applications.
For example, if you have applications `app1`, `app2`, `app3`, and `app4` that belong to the same business or team, you can group them under **Project 1**.

By default, Argo CD provides a **default project**.
Each application **must** belong to a project — specifying a project is **mandatory**.

### **Benefits of Using Projects**

Projects are especially useful in **multi-team environments** because they allow for better organization and access control.
You can:

* **Restrict or allow specific sources** (Git repositories, Helm repos, etc.) a project can use.
* **Restrict or allow destination clusters and namespaces** that applications within the project can deploy to.
* **Restrict specific Kubernetes resource types** (e.g., only allow Deployments, DaemonSets, or StatefulSets).

---

## **3. Desired State vs Actual State**

Argo CD operates based on two states:

* **Desired State:**
  The configuration stored in your Git repository.
  It represents how your environment *should* look.

* **Actual State:**
  The configuration that is currently running in your Kubernetes cluster.

Argo CD continuously compares these two states to ensure your cluster matches the configuration defined in Git.

---

## **4. Sync**

**Sync** is the process that brings the **actual state** in line with the **desired state**.
When you trigger a sync, Argo CD deploys the manifests from Git (desired state) into the destination cluster (actual state).

---

## **5. Refresh / Compare**

**Refresh** or **Compare** is the process of checking for differences between the desired state (in Git) and the actual state (in the cluster).
Argo CD uses this comparison to determine if an application is:

* **In Sync** – The cluster matches the Git configuration.
* **Out of Sync** – There are differences between the cluster and Git.

By default, Argo CD automatically refreshes applications **every 3 minutes**.

### **Summary**

| Concept             | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Application**     | Defines source (manifests) and destination (cluster/namespace).          |
| **Project**         | Logical grouping of applications; provides access and resource controls. |
| **Desired State**   | Configuration defined in Git.                                            |
| **Actual State**    | What is currently running in the cluster.                                |
| **Sync**            | Process of aligning actual state with desired state.                     |
| **Refresh/Compare** | Process of checking differences between desired and actual states.       |
